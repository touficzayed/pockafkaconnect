# Bank to Kafka partition deterministic mapping
# Format: bankCode,partitionNumber
# 20 partitions total, ~10 banks per partition at 200 banks

# Partitions 0-4: existing banks

# Extend this file as new banks are onboarded.
# Banks not listed here will fall back to Murmur2 hashing.
# To generate a balanced mapping for N banks across 20 partitions:
#   for i in $(seq 1 N); do printf "BNK%03d,%d\n" $i $(( (i-1) % 20 )); done
